TextGuru: The Text Expander

TextGuru is a versatile text expansion tool aimed at enhancing your typing efficiency. It allows users to create custom shortcuts that automatically expand into pre-defined phrases, sentences, or even commands. Running seamlessly in the background, it helps reduce repetitive typing, making it ideal for professionals and anyone seeking to optimize their workflow and save time.

DO NOT OPEN OR DELETE THE JSON FILE

A. How to Store Shortcuts:

1.The "shortcuts.txt" file is your friend. Use the text file to store all your shortcuts.
2.Each short word and Expansion text is stored as a pair separated by colon ":". 
Example: check:This is a test. 
Here "check" is the short word and "This is a test" is corresponding Expansion text.
3.No numbering or quotes("") needed, and space is not recommended after the ":"
4.Each shortcut is stored on new line. Kindly follow it for best experience.

B. How to use the Tool:
1.Double clicking the Application file will run the script.
2.Consider putting some shortcuts in the text file before running the script.
3.After you double click the application a GUI or a small window will appear on the screen.
4.Don't worry. It means the application is now running perfectly.
5.On the window there are two buttons "Pause" and "End". One to pause the tool but not end the script completely. the other button to end the tool. Pausing will stop the tool from listening to input and expand it immediately. So just pause the script when you don't want to use the tool and resume anytime.
6.Now open any text editor like MS Word to test the tool. 
7.Type the short word that you stored in text file. Considering my above example (check:This is a test). So type "check" and see the magic. It's case sensitive.
8.The word "check" will be replaced by is corresponding big text that is "This is a test".
9.The tool works with any application where you can type.

IMPORTANT THINGS TO REMEMBER
1.There should be no line gap between two shortcuts defined in your text file (shortcuts.txt)
2.The short word that will be defined are case sensitive i.e. "Hi" is not same as "hi".
3.When the tool is running and you decide to add new shortcuts in the text file, please close/end the tool for changes to reflect before you start using the new shortcuts.


Congratulations!!! Now you can use tool without problems.

Happy Expanding!
